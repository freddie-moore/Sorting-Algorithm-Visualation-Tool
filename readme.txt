Sorting Algorithm Visualisation Tool

This is a brief programme I built to help implement and visualise two common sorting algorithms, in a unique manner which I have not seen done before.
The programme is relatively simple on the front and back end with minimal UI, as the main focus of this project was on the sorting algorithms themselves.
The programme is designed in a very modular fashion which should make it easy to implement new sorting algorithms if desired.
The programme is built 100% with Python and the PyGame libraries.
